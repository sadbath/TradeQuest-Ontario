## üßê About The Project

Every year, students ask the same questions: <em>‚ÄúHow do I get rich quick?‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúI want a six-figure job.‚Äù</em><br/><br/>
But the truth is, there‚Äôs no shortcut‚Äî<strong>just smarter, faster paths that schools often don‚Äôt talk about</strong>. This site was built to flip the script and show that skilled trades in Ontario can offer high pay, real freedom, and low (or no) debt.
 
### Who is this for?
*   High school students exploring post-secondary options.
*   Parents and guidance counselors looking for resources.
*   Anyone considering a career change into a hands-on, in-demand field.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers (Running Locally)

Since this is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project, there are no complex build steps.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tradequest-ontario.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tradequest-ontario
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

For the best experience (to avoid any potential browser issues with local file access), it's recommended to use a simple local server. If you use VS Code, the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is a great choice.
